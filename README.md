# EvoGym
EvoGym Page
The page was developed using React + TS stack. Framer motion was used in order to add some smooth, eye-catching animations. Proper form handling as well as its validation was taken care of using react-hook-form.
To make sure that all types are in check and each component receives the proper data type in their props - interfaces and types were added. 
The project was developed and built using Vite bundler, which allows to optimize the updated during development code and render the code quicker due to HMR preference over ESM.
