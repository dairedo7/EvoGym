# EvoGym
EvoGym Page
The page was developed using React + TS stack. Framer motion was used in order to add some smooth, eye-catching animations. Proper form handling as well as its validation 
was taken care of using react-hook-form.
To make sure that all types are in check and each component receives the proper data type in their props - interfaces and types were added.
